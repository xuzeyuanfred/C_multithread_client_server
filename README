CS 111 Project 1b
Name:Zeyuan XU
ID: 004255573

This project is built on project 1a, mainly the parts:
1. setting up pipelines between parent and child process, in this case the server program and "/bin/bash"
2. setting up the input mode as noncanonical mode, as well as the input methods from the prvious project, which is from stdin (keyboard) to parent, then to shell.

the added features from this project include:
3. a socket connecting the server and the client program, and different form the pipes, socket is more convinient and it can go in both directions. the --port option and the whole socket API is learned from "GNU C library" chapter 16, and "the LInux Programming Interface", chapter 62,63. 

4. the --log option and --encrypt option. The log option is used to record the I/Os as captured from server to client and client to server. In normal mode, the message to server will be recorded as "SENT %d bytes: %s" format and the message received from server will be recorded as "RECEIVED %d bytes: %s". The --encrypt option makes use of a software package called mcrypt-dev on Linux, and the whole API and tutorial can be found online at "mcrypt.hellbug.gr". It implements the encryption on an end-to-end connection, and encrypt and decrypt messages on both client and server end, much like the mechanism of a TCP connection.

This submission includes two c source files, one README, one Makefile, and one key.me file.
The server.c is used to build the server program
The client.c is used to build the client program.
The server program is invoked as "./server --port=<portno>" as without encryption flag, and "./server --port=<portno> --encrypt" as with encryption flag.
The client program runs after the server waits. it is used with
"./client --port=<portno> --log=<logfile> --encrypt" when used with full functionality.
key.me is used for encryption in both the server and the client program. The cryptography algorithm used in this program is the "blowfish".

the spec looks better than the first one, since we now have a picture to describe what to do.
